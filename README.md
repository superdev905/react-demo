# React 2016: master react, redux, immutable.js, and webpack

This is the demo project for [React 2016: master react, redux, immutable.js, and webpack](http://www.reactuniversity.com/react-2016)

## Requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * NVM is the easiest way to manage Node. [Its setup instructions here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation). Then run `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`, which installs the latest version of Node.js and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing `node`. With nvm you can install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.
    * New to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?

If you have not already done so, clone this repo for this tutorial.

There are two main directories: `finished` and `unfinished`. You will be following along in the `unfinished` directory. `finished` is available if you are stuck or want to skip ahead. Be warned however that copy and pasting from `finished` may not always work since it represents the end state of the game. If you copy code from `finished`, it is possible that code depends on other code that is not going to be added until later in the tutorial.

Once you have all your requirements set up, run `npm install` from the root of the repository to install all the required dependencies. All the trouble of configuring webpack and the dev-server have been done for you. All you need to do is run `npm start` from the root of the repository and navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser. Of course, if you're just starting out there isn't anything in the `unfinished` directory yet. However, you can see the finished demo by running `npm run finished` and navigating to `localhost:8080` in your browser.
