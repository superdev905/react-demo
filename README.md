# React Under the Hood

## Setup

Prerequisites
* Git
* Node.js
* NPM

If you haven't already done so, clone the [demo repository](https://github.com/freddyrangel/react-under-the-hood) for this tutorial.

There are two main directories: `finished` and `unfinished`. You will be following along in the `unfinished` directory. `finished` is available if you are stuck or want to skip ahead.

`cd` into `unfinished` and run `npm i`. This will install all the dependencies required for this demo.

Once that is finished, you can start the server by running `npm start` and navigating to `localhost:4000` in your browser.
